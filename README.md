## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felix and I'm a Full Stack engineer currently looking for an entry-level SWE role. I transitioned into tech by completing the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp) bootcamp, and before becoming a SWE I was a Research Assistant at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineering intern at an early-stage startup called [Ballmecca](https://ballmecca.com/)
- :computer: The technologies I'm familiar with are: CSS, Dart, Firebase/ Firestore, Flask, Flutter/ FlutterFlow, Git, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Pytest, Python, React, SQL, SQLite, VS Code
- ðŸ˜„ My favorite project that I've created is the first full stack app that I built completely on my own. It's a sports-based app named [PickupPal](https://github.com/flaniyanjr/PickupPal). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaeg2sTJlZI) is a video demo of the app!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an avid chess player who began playing at the age of 9

My email is flaniyanjr@gmail, feel free to reach out!
